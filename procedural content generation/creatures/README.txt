You can run my code by opening the CreatureScene and hitting the play button in the Unity editor. 

My creatures are fantsay ones that follow the exquisite corpse game, with aesthetically different limbs and wings being mixed and matched.

Wing Types: Dragon, Fairy, Angel

Limb Types: Hairy Spider Legs, Sparkly Tentacle Legs, Shiny Bionic Legs

My favorite wings are the dragon ones and my favorite limbs are the tentacles! I hope you enjoy my creatures!
