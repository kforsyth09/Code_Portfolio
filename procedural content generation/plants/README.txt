- To run my code, navigate to the Scenes folder in the project assets, open TreeScene.unity, and hit the play button.
- To navigate in order to see all my trees, use the arrow keys as follows.
        Up to move forward
        Left to turn left
        Right to turn right 
        Down to move backward

Tree 1 (far left at start)
- Orthotropic (tends to grow upwards)
- This tree is in the summer, hence it has many green leaves.

Tree 2 (middle at start)
- Plagiotropic (tends to grow out/sideways)
- This tree is in the spring, hence it has some green leaves and blue flowers sprouting.


Tree 3 (far right at start)
- Normal (no explicit directional growth tendancy between up and out)
- This tree is in fall, hence the leaves are red, orange, and yellow with some left on the branches but many fallen to the ground beneath the tree.

I hope you like my trees, my favorite is number 3!
